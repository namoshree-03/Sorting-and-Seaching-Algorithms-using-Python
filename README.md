# Sorting and Searching Algorithms using Python ⚡

Beginner-friendly Python implementations of **essential sorting and searching algorithms**.  
Each algorithm is written in a simple and clean way to help understand the core concepts of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).**

## 📂 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔍 Searching
1. **Linear Search (`linear search.py`)**  
   - Sequentially checks each element in the list.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n).  

2. **Binary Search (`binary search.py`)**  
   - Works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  
   - Time Complexity: O(log n).  

### 🔄 Sorting
3. **Bubble Sort (`bubble sort.py`)**  
   - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n²).  

4. **Insertion Sort (`insertion sort.py`)**  
   - Builds the sorted list one element at a time.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n²).  

5. **Selection Sort (`selection sort.py`)**  
   - Finds the minimum element and places it in the correct position.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n²).  

6. **Merge Sort (`merge sort.py`)**  
   - Divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits, sorts, and merges.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n).  

7. **Quick Sort (`quick sort.py`)**  
   - Divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses a pivot to partition elements.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average).
