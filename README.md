# Sorting and Searching Algorithms using Python

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly implementations of common sorting and searching algorithms using Python.

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file and includes comments for better understanding.

## 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search** – Sequentially searches for an element in a list.
- **Binary Search** – Efficiently searches in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the range in half.

## 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort** – Selects the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
- **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort** – Divides the list and merges sorted sublists.
- **Quick Sort** – Uses divide-and-conquer by selecting a pivot element.
